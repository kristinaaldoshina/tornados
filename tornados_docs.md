__tor_f_scale:__ F0, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, unknown  
Fujita Scale describes the strength of the tornado based on the amount and type of
damage caused by the tornado. The F-scale of damage will vary in the destruction area;
therefore, the highest value of the F-scale is recorded for each event.

- F0 - 40-72 mph - Light damage (e.g., broken branches, shallow-rooted trees pushed over)
- F1 - 73-112 mph - Moderate damage (e.g., mobile homes overturned, moving cars pushed off roads)
- F2 - 113-157 mph - Considerable damage (e.g., roofs torn off, large trees snapped or uprooted)
- F3 - 158-206 mph - Severe damage (e.g., trains overturned, walls torn off houses)
- F4 - 207-260 mph - Devastating damage (e.g., houses leveled, cars thrown significant distances)
- F5 - 261-318 mph - Incredible damage (e.g., strong framed houses swept away, deformation of steel-reinforced structures)
